/*  Problem: Write a program to create a customer’s bill for a 
    company. Write a program to create a customer’s bill for a 
    company. The company sells only five different products. 
    TV, Monitor, Flash Drive, Hard Drives, DeskJet Printer. The
    unit price is K400, K220, K35.20, K150 and K300, respectively.
    The program must read the quantity of each piece of equipment
    purchased from the keyboard. It then calculates the cost of 
    each item, the subtotal and the total cost after an 8.35% sales tax.
    
    Algorithm: 
    1. Start 
    2. Declare quantity variables (int)
    3. Declare price constants (float)
    4. Prompt user for quantities
    5. Calculate item totals
    6. Calculate subtotal
    7. Calculate tax (8.35%)
    8. Calculate final total
    9. Display formatted bill
    10. End
